# HCAS React Implementation Plan (TypeScript, Material UI, React Native Paper)

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for building the Health Center Automation System (HCAS) frontend using React (TypeScript) for web and React Native for mobile, with Material UI and React Native Paper for UI components.

## Key Principles
- **Feature-based structure:** Each folder is self-contained and represents a logical feature or module.
- **Dual platform:** All prompts and plans specify both web (Material UI) and native (React Native Paper) approaches.
- **TypeScript-first:** All code and component examples are in TypeScript.
- **Modern stack:** Redux Toolkit, React Router/Navigation, Formik+Yup, Axios+React Query, JWT, ESLint, Jest, Sentry, Vercel/Netlify/Expo.
- **OpenAPI-driven:** All forms, models, and API integrations are generated from `openapi.json`.
- **AI-friendly:** All documentation is written for both human and AI agents.

## Folder Structure
- `plan.md`: User flows, UI/UX, and React-specific notes (web + native)
- `endpoints.md`: API endpoints, request/response schemas
- `models.md`: Data models, validation, and TypeScript interfaces
- `[feature]_screen.md`: Detailed UI/UX prompt for the main screen/component

## How to Use
1. Start at `00-branding-ux/` and proceed in order.
2. For each feature:
   - Read `plan.md` for user flows and UI/UX.
   - Use `endpoints.md` for API integration (Axios + React Query).
   - Use `models.md` for TypeScript interfaces and validation (Formik + Yup).
   - Follow UI/UX prompts for Material UI (web) and React Native Paper (native) components.
3. All code should be robust, maintainable, and accessible, following best practices in `99-best-practices/`.

## Dual Web & Native Support
- All features are designed for both web and native.
- Where UI/UX differs, prompts include both, clearly labeled.
- Use Material UI for web and React Native Paper for native.

## Best Practices
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management.
- Use React Router (web) and React Navigation (native) for routing.
- Use Formik + Yup for forms and validation.
- Use Axios for API calls and React Query for data fetching/caching.
- Use JWT for authentication (localStorage/web, AsyncStorage/native).
- Use react-i18next for localization.
- Use ESLint for linting and Jest for testing.
- Use Sentry for error tracking.
- Deploy to Vercel, Netlify (web), and Expo (native).

This plan ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable React frontend for HCAS, ready for both web and mobile platforms.
